# Pong
This is a quick remake of Pong in Java -- not much else to it!

<b>A Few Notes:</b>
- The current method for checking for collisions is a bit inaccurate, particularly when the Ball intersects with the corner of a Paddle.
- The game doesn't reset Paddle positions when a player scores.
- Ball collisions with the Paddles are not dynamic (i.e. the Ball moves at a constant speed and the angle of reflection does not change depending on where the collision occurs      relative to the paddle).
- There is no AI for single-player games. 
- There is no UI aside from score labels.

I will eventually update the program to accomodate everything stated and more. 

Feel free to download and modify the source code as you see fit!
